// <!-- 1. The forecast today is 293 Kelvin. To start, create a variable named kelvin, and set it equal to 293.
let Kelvin = 293;

console.log(Kelvin);

// The value saved to kelvin will stay constant. Choose the variable type with this in mind.
// 2. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

// 293 is a contant value
const value= "293";

console.log(value);

// 3. Celsius is similar to Kelvin — the only difference is that Celsius is 273 degrees less than Kelvin.
// Let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273 from the kelvin variable. Store the result in another variable, named celsius.
// 4. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

// Celsius is set to 273 and Kelvin was previously set to 293
// Substracting the difference of one another display the result in the console
let Celsius = 273;
let diff = Kelvin - Celsius;
console.log("Celsius: ", diff)

// 5. Use this equation to calculate Fahrenheit, then store the answer in a variable named fahrenheit.
// Fahrenheit = Celsius * (9/5) + 32
// 6. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.
// Multiplicating Celsius degrees by the formula display it then in the console.
let  mult = diff * (9/5) + 32;
console.log("Fahrenheit: ", mult)


// 7. When you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you often get a decimal number. (Don't worry about this just yet). Log the temperature in farenheit to the console. -->
