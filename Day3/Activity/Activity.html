        <h3>How do identify it ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Boletus Edulis</strong> <em>(also know as Penny bun, Porcini, Cep, King bolete)</em> cap is 7-20 cm across. White when very young (sometimes also as adults with the lack of luminosity), maturing to look like a crusty brown roll, hence the name <strong>Penny Bun</strong>. The edge of the cap is often white.</li>
            <li> <strong>Porcini</strong> has small white pores which can yellow to brown a bit with age.</li>
            <li> <strong>Cep</strong> stem 10-14 cm long, 2-4 cm diameter. Thick, bulbous and white ageing to slightly tan yellow. The stem has a fine net like covering just under the cap and sometimes extending all the way down the stem, solid when young, fresh or free from maggots.</li>
            <li>The flesh is white and can be yellowing while ageing.</li>
            <li>Taste / Smell Excellent raw or fried in butter when fresh. Very mushroomy, one of the best species to dry where the mushroom flavour is enhanced.</li>
            <li>You can forage the <strong>King bolete</strong> in mixed woodland but found more with beech, oak or pine.</li>
            </ul>
